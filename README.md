Azure and .NET Core 3.1 API

## Project Progress
1. Currently I have a local dB running ```SQL SERVER 19``` manages with ```SSMS```, linked with a ```.NET 3.1``` API.
2. I will make use of ```swagger``` to test and document the API return codes and functionality.
3. Next, I will try to link the cloud dB with the API, to test and populate the database with a ```add-migration``` ```.NET``` command.

## Branching Strategy 
1. The main branch was used to deploy the initial API with swagger.
2. The developer branch is used to introduce Authentication within the API requests.
